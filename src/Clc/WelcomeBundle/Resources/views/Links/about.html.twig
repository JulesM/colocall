	<h1>{% trans %}About Coloc'all{% endtrans %}</h1>
	<p>{% trans %}Coloc'all started with an idea from 2 students in French engineering schools who met during their bachelor degree. After having lived in shared appartments in different countries they realised that a simple and clear app could solve much more problems than the mere paper sheet they used to keep track of their expenses and to-dos. Motivated by their will to do things they decided to create it: Coloc'all was born.{% endtrans %}</p>

	<h2>{% trans %}What does Coloc'all mean ?{% endtrans %}</h2>

	<p>{% trans %}In French, a "coloc" is both a shared housing (colocation) and a flatmate (colocataire). Coloc'all means we want everybody to prefer living in a shared flat than alone, and Coloc'all is here to help that. Because when it works well, an experience in a shared flat is a thing we wish everyone to live once{% endtrans %}</p>
